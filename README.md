# House price prediction using machine learning

## Aim

The housing market is very volatile and is affected by various factors such as economic growth, inflation, and other things such as businesses in a certain locality
closing driving down the demand and subsequently the price of the house.

There are a couple of structural attributes that affect the price of the house. These include attributes such as the size of the living room, basement and garage. The
number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a house, availability of amenities such as swimming pool, gym or jacuzzi make for a very expenive house, the building quality and
architectural design style also affect the cost of the builidng. The cost of buildings is also affected by the location of the house. Houses in bad neighbourhoods tend
to fetch lower prices compared to houses in good meighbourhoods.

Renovation status of a house to some affects the price of a house to some extent.These factors can lay a good foundation in development of models that can predict
house prices with a decent accuracy

This project aims at a creating a prediction model that can accurately predict house prices. 

## Regression models employed
- Multiple linear regression, 
- quantile regression, 
- ridge regression, 
- Lasso regression 
- elastic net regression 

## Metric of success
A model with an r_squared square (Variance score) greater than 0.90 implying over 90% of the data can be fit into the model is developed.

The high score is set due to the narrow margins in the housing market worldwide
